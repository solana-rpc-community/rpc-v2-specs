# Solana RPC v2 Project
A repository for RPC v2 project related specifications, documents and discussions.

## Project Objectives
1. Bring experts around the Solana RPC API together to share and discuss ideas.
2. Define way forward of the Solana RPC API.
3. Discuss ways to interface between RPC and the Solana validator.
4. Create a **Vanilla RPCv2 implementation** outside the Solana Validator Core.
5. Make building blocks **Vanilla RPCv2 implementation** available to the community.

### API Subject Domains
Solana RPC API can be segmented into several subject domains.
Many discussions and concepts will be structured around these domains.
