# rpc-v2-specs
A repository for RPC-v2 related specification documents.

## Objectives
1. Discuss changes to the standard RPC API. [https://docs.solana.com/api/http#json-rpc-api-reference]
2. Create a reference implementation that will support the standard API using common open-source software tools. The primary objectives are API compatibility and vendor configurability. Performance is a secondary concern for the reference implementation because vendor-specific infrastructure will ultimately determine performance.
